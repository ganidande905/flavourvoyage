# Flavour Voyage  

Welcome to **Flavour Voyage**, your passport to culinary exploration! 🚀🍽️  

## About the Project  
Flavour Voyage is a **static frontend webpage** designed to provide users with recipe suggestions based on the ingredients they have in their pantry. While the description mentions AI, this project is purely for frontend practice and does not include any backend or AI functionality.  

## Why I Built This  
I built **Flavour Voyage** to practice my **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** skills. This project allowed me to:  
- Improve my **HTML structure** and semantic elements  
- Experiment with **CSS styling** and responsive design  
- Use **JavaScript** to handle dynamic interactions on the page  

## Features  
✅ **Simple and Clean UI** – Designed using HTML and CSS  
✅ **Dynamic User Input** – Uses JavaScript to accept and display pantry ingredients  
✅ **Recipe Display** – (Mock) recipe suggestions based on static data  
✅ **Practice Project** – No backend or AI, just frontend exploration  

## How to Use  
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser  
3. Enter ingredients (dummy functionality)  
4. View static recipe suggestions  

## Future Improvements  
- Enhance the UI with better CSS animations  
- Add real-time filtering using JavaScript  
- Implement an actual AI-powered recipe generator in the future  

This project is purely for **practice and learning**. Feel free to explore, modify, and improve upon it! 🚀  

### Bon appétit! 🍽️
